        <h2>My greatest Inspiration</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I really can't complete a personal message without including my
            greatest inspiration: <em>Rihanna</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Asides from being a remarkable singer and performer, she's stunning,
            always learning, doing something different and stepping out of her
            comfort zone. That's exactly the kind of person I aspire to be

            Enjoy this beautiful performance at the superbowl while we wait
            patiently (and maybe hopelessly) for a new album
